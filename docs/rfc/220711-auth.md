# Summary and Motivation

In this RFC I propose a design for an authentication, authorization, and encryption
service for delta. A well crafted security system is essential for any enterprise
control system. Delta may be used in both public or private networks, distributing
sensitive and operation critical data between its nodes and to its clients. A
security breach could, in the worst cases, result in the loss of millions of dollars
of hardware or even life.

Unfortunately, designing a secure system is a challenge. Keeping up to date with
best practices, searching for and eliminating vulnerabilities, and implementing
granular access controls is a daunting task.

Delta's security system targets three key areas of concern:

1. Authentication - Is an entity (node, user, other software) who they say they are?
2. Authorization - Does an entity have permission to access or modify the requested
   resource?
3. Encryption - Is all communication between entities unreadable by outside parties?

The MVP implementation defines key interfaces to cover these areas of concern in a
modular pattern, while providing rudimentary implementations underneath. The idea is to
keep ourselves from binding to specific authentication, authorization, or encryption
paradigms (e.g OAuth2, LDAp, RBAC, ABAC, ACL, etc.), and instead use a generic interface
that can be replaced or expanded for different configurations or future iterations.
