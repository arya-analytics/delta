# Summary and Motivation

In this RFC I propose a design for an authentication, authorization, and encryption
service for delta. A well crafted security system is essential for any enterprise
control system. Delta may be used in both public or private networks, distributing
sensitive and operation critical data between its nodes and to its clients. A
security breach could, in the worst cases, result in the loss of millions of dollars
of hardware or even life.

Unfortunately, designing a secure system is a challenge. Keeping up to date with
best practices, searching for and eliminating vulnerabilities, and implementing
granular access controls is a daunting task.

Delta's security system targets three key areas of concern:

1. Authentication - Is an entity (node, user, other software) who they say they are?
2. Authorization - Does an entity have permission to access or modify the requested
   resource?
3. Encryption - Is all communication between entities unreadable by outside parties?

The MVP implementation defines key interfaces to cover these areas of concern in a
modular pattern, while providing rudimentary implementations underneath. The idea is to
keep ourselves from binding to specific authentication, authorization, or encryption
paradigms (e.g OAuth2, LDAp, RBAC, ABAC, ACL, etc.), and instead use a generic interface
that can be replaced or expanded for different configurations or future iterations.

# Design

## Authentication

All authentication in Delta is done using a `Credentials` payload:

```go
package irrelivant

type Credentials struct {
	Username string
	Password string
}

type Authenticator interface {
	Authenticate(cred Credentials) error
}

```

If the combination is not valid, `Authenticate` will return an error, letting the caller
know it's not safe to proceed with those credentials. It's common to see an interface
that looks more like this

```go
package irrelivant

type Authenticator interface {
	Authenticate(cred Credentials) (User, error)
}
```

The `Authenticate` method returns both a user object and an error. Delta's authenticator
intentionally does not follow this pattern. It is not the responsibility of the
authenticator to store or retrieve any user related data; its only job is to ensure
that a user with those credentials does in fact exist. The caller is responsible for
fetching any user related data after authentication is successful. This is, of
course, dependent on the username being unique.

The Authenticator interface can be implemented by a variety of different systems such as
LDAP, OAuth2, or a cluster internal system. Multiple authenticators can be integrated
into a chain of responsibility, where credentials are checked until an authenticator
either approves the credentials or the chain is exhausted.

This interface can also be extended in future iterations to support certificate-based
authentication and more.
